It's no secret that the basic set of cards with which the application is supplied is often not enough. However, it is possible to add additional maps yourself. Here you will find two sets of [raster][07] online-maps:

### Basic set
A great option for beginners. If you still not sure what cards you should upload in the navigation app, you'll start with this collection. Here is a minimum set of the most necessary, in my opinion, cards.  This set is suitable not only to get acquainted with the different types of maps that can be installed in the application, but also quite cope with most everyday tasks.

### Full set
If you already know what kind of maps you need, then this set is for you. Note that it already includes maps from other compilers collections: [Erelen][6], [Dreame][7], [ms.Galileo-app][8], [Custom-maps-sourse][9] and some others. And as there are many maps from the program [SAS.Planet][10]. A total of about a hundred cards included. Here are some of them:

- Maps for city (Google, Here, Bing, Yandex, 2gis)
- Satellites (Google, ERSI, Here, Mapbox, Yandex) 
- OSM-based maps (Mapnik, Cyclemap, Outdoors, OpenTopoMaps, OpenSeaMap, OpenSnowMap)
- Digitized raster topomaps (Soviet military maps, GGC, Hiking maps with local coverage)
- Information maps (Wikimapia)

> Attention! Maps based on Yandex are made in a non-standard projection. To Guru Maps was able to show them without distortion, they have to [transform][02] on the fly. So be prepared for the fact that these maps will load relatively slowly.

### How to set up the traffic layer?
I note that among the cards in this collection there are several dynamic. I mean all the maps with a layer of corrent traffic sitiation. There should also include a layer with moving ships Openseamap. It is worth noting that the application is not designed for such cards, so in order to be able to work with them will need to do additional settings each time.

##### The first option - purging the cache:
* Open the settings menu
* Select `Cashe info`
* Toggle the switch `Map refresh`
* Drag the slider to the left (actual map)

As a result, the map will be periodically updated once in a certain (though relatively large) period of time.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://gurumaps.app/manuals/ios/assets/cache_info.png" width="200"/>
</p>

##### The second option is a manual deletion of the cache:
* Open the settings menu
* Select `Cashe info`
* Find the map you are interested in in the list
* Delete cache by clicking on the red circle to the left of the map name

This removes the cache and reloads the entire map except for the area on the screen. To update it, you need to switch to any other map before deleting the cache.

---

That's all. If you have any suggestions what other sources of maps should be added to the collection (and what to remove), then send me an e-mail. It is desirable to attach a link to the page with the map of interest to the letter. And, of course, report bugs and inaccuracies on the site.
